## Project Overview

-   **Name:** `vmlc-backend` — backend service for the Verboheit Mathematics League Competition (VMLC).
-   **Purpose:** Provide HTTP APIs and real-time channels for participant registration, exams, scoring, leaderboards, and administrative workflows. The backend favors short-lived API responses and offloads heavy work (scoring, file validation, notifications) to Celery.

## Architecture (detailed)

-   **HTTP API (REST):** Built with Django 5.x + Django REST Framework. Core business logic (models, serializers, viewsets) is in `vmlc/`. APIs follow DRF patterns with serializers in `vmlc/serializers/` and API routers registered in `config/urls.py` and `vmlc/urls.py`.
-   **Real-time (WebSockets):** Implemented using `channels` + `daphne`. ASGI routing is wired in `config/asgi.py` which mounts `comms.routing.websocket_urlpatterns` behind `comms.middleware.DualAuthMiddlewareStack` (a custom auth stack that allows token and session fallback). Consumers and broadcast logic live in `comms/` and some consumers also in `vmlc/consumers.py`.
-   **Background processing (Celery):** Celery is configured in `config/celery.py` and tasks are auto-discovered from installed apps. Workers run with named queues; the development compose file launches a `celery_worker` and `celery_beat`. Queue names used in `compose.dev.yml` include: `default,emails,comms,scoring,files,reports,cache` — keep new tasks aligned to these queues when possible.
-   **Persistence & Storage:** PostgreSQL is the primary DB. Redis is used for caching and as the Celery broker. Media storage uses AWS S3 via `django-storages` and `boto3` (signed URLs and storage backends are implemented in `vmlc/storage_backends.py`).
-   **Observability:** OpenTelemetry instrumentation is present; OTEL env vars are set in `compose.*.yml`. Grafana dashboards and Prometheus config live in `grafana/` and `prometheus.yml`.

## Environment Configuration

The project uses environment variables for sensitive data and deployment-specific settings. A template file, `.example.env`, lists all possible environment variables used across different environments.

To configure your environment:

1.  **Create an environment-specific file:**
    *   For local development (without Docker): Create a `.env` file in the project root.
    *   For Dockerized local development: Create a `.env` file in the project root.
    *   For staging deployment: Create a `staging.env` file in the project root.
    *   For production deployment: Create a `prod.env` file in the project root.

2.  **Copy variables from `.example.env`:** Copy the contents of `.example.env` into your newly created environment file (e.g., `.env`) and fill in the appropriate values.

3.  **Set `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`:** This crucial environment variable tells Django which settings file to load.
    *   `config.settings.dev` for local development (without Docker).
    *   `config.settings.docker_dev` for local development (with Docker).
    *   `config.settings.staging` for staging deployments.
    *   `config.settings.prod` for production deployments.

    *Example for local development (`.env` file):*
    ```
    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.dev
    SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    DEBUG=True
    # ... other variables
    ```
    *Note: `manage.py` and `wsgi.py` usually set a default `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`. Ensure your specific environment overrides it if necessary.*

## Key Files & Directories (expanded)

-   `vmlc/` — core app: models (`vmlc/models.py`), view logic (`vmlc/views.py`), serializers (`vmlc/serializers/`), and application tasks (`vmlc/tasks.py`). Look here first for domain logic (exams, candidates, scoring).
-   `comms/` — real-time module: `consumers.py`, `middleware.py` (check `DualAuthMiddlewareStack`), `routing.py`, `tasks.py` and `utils.py` used by broadcasts and websocket handlers. Review `comms/tests.py` for consumer test patterns.
-   `config/` — project bootstrap: `asgi.py` (ASGI app + websocket stack), `wsgi.py`, `celery.py` (beat schedule + autoload), and `urls.py` (API routes + health endpoints).
-   `scripts/` — container lifecycle helpers: `entrypoint.sh`, `runmigrations.sh` (DB wait, migrate, collectstatic for prod), `runserver.sh`. These are executed by containers; keep changes minimal and robust to missing env vars.
-   `compose.*.yml` & `Dockerfile` — how the app is built and composed locally and in staging/prod. `Dockerfile` defines multiple stages (`development`, `test`, `staging`, `production`) — use the `development` stage for local iterative work.

## Developer Workflows & Commands (practical tips)

-   Start the full development environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.dev.yml up --build
    docker compose exec django python manage.py migrate
    ```

    Notes:
    -   The compose file uses service names `django`, `db`, `redis`, `celery_worker`, `celery_beat`. `db-migrate` runs `./scripts/runmigrations.sh` to perform safer migrations with readiness checks.
    -   If you change the Docker image or Python deps, rebuild the image and bring containers down first:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.dev.yml down --volumes --remove-orphans
    docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.dev.yml up --build
    ```

-   Running locally without Docker (development loop):

    ```bash
    # Ensure DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE is set in your shell or .env file (see Environment Configuration section)
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

-   Running tests:

    ```bash
    pytest
    # or run tests for an app
    pytest vmlc/tests
    ```

    Tips:
    -   For quick shell work use: `docker compose exec django python manage.py shell`.

## Conventions & Patterns to Preserve (detailed)

-   Environment-driven settings: Settings are loaded based on `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` and environment-specific `.env` files. Refer to the [Environment Configuration](#environment-configuration) section for details.
-   Task discovery and queues: Celery uses `app.autodiscover_tasks()`; task functions are registered by name and routed to queues by the worker `-Q` argument in `compose.dev.yml`. Add new queues in both `compose` files and worker startup flags if needed.
-   WebSocket authentication: `DualAuthMiddlewareStack` supports multiple auth schemes (session & token). Modify middleware with caution — tests for `comms/test_consumers.py` illustrate expected behaviors.
-   Migrations & startup: `scripts/runmigrations.sh` contains strict checks (DB readiness, Django system checks). Avoid adding long-running initialization steps to this script; it's intended to be idempotent and fast.

## Integration & Infra Notes (concrete)

-   S3 / Storage:
    -   `django-storages` and `boto3` dependencies are present. Storage backends live in `vmlc/storage_backends.py` — review for signed URL generation and bucket naming conventions before changing behavior.

-   OpenTelemetry & Metrics:
    -   OTEL is enabled in compose via `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and related env vars. Instrumentation packages are listed in `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`. Avoid duplicate instrumentation in both middleware and app startup.

-   Deployment & CI:
    -   Deployment manifests live in `stack.*.yml` GitHub Actions workflows are in `.github/workflows/` (`deploy-staging.yml`, `deploy-prod.yml`) — coordinate infra changes with ops.

## Examples

1)  Minimal Celery task skeleton (place in `vmlc/tasks.py` or `vmlc/tasks/<module>.py`):

    ```python
    from celery import shared_task

    @shared_task(name='recalculate_leaderboard')
    def recalculate_leaderboard(league_id):
            # Import inside task to avoid startup cost
            from vmlc.models import Leaderboard

            # Implementation: fetch candidates, compute scores, persist snapshot
            Leaderboard.recalculate_for_league(league_id)

            return True
    ```

    Notes: use short, stable task `name=` values for backward compatibility with worker queues and monitoring.

2)  Minimal WebSocket consumer skeleton (in `comms/consumers.py` or a new file):

    ```python
    from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncJsonWebsocketConsumer

    class NotificationsConsumer(AsyncJsonWebsocketConsumer):
            async def connect(self):
                    # `DualAuthMiddlewareStack` ensures `scope["user"]` may be set
                    if not self.scope.get('user') or not self.scope['user'].is_authenticated:
                            await self.close()
                            return
                    await self.accept()

            async def receive_json(self, content, **kwargs):
                    # Handle client messages
                    await self.send_json({"echo": content})

            async def disconnect(self, code):
                    pass
    ```

    Register in `comms/routing.py` and ensure `config/asgi.py` mounts the `comms.routing.websocket_urlpatterns` with the `DualAuthMiddlewareStack`.

## Quick Editing Checklist

-   Run linting and tests after changes: `pytest`, `pylint` (configured in `pyproject.toml`).
-   If changing Celery tasks/queues, update `compose.*.yml` worker `- -Q` flags and add beat entries in `config/celery.py` if periodic.
-   If changing auth or middleware: update `comms/tests.py` and `vmlc/tests` to cover token/session fallbacks.
